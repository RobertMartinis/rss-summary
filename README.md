# RSS-summary
Reads an RSS-feed, captures all the articles in the link-tags, and summarizes them in a few sentences. The summaries are then written to the respective articles description tag. This allows you to read
summaries of articles directly in your RSS reader, instead of having to open the article in your browser.
